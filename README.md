Short 1 hour introductions to R-related topics such as creating R projects, using GitHub through RStudio and more 

## **Session 1:**
### *R-projects*

The foundation to reproducible research starts not with your PI, your lab colleagues or your collaborators. It starts with you! How do you organise your research projects? How do you keep track of the data as you collect it. How readily can you go back to a set of analyses you've performed in the past and re-run to include new variables you may have at your disposal or, perhaps more importantly, confirm that critical calculation your performed 6 months ago?

The answer to many, if not all of these questions, can be found through the use of R/Rstudio and implementation of a defined research project structure made possible with R-projects.

## **Session 2:**
### *Reproducible reports with R Markdown and knitr*

Rmarkdown allows you to move directly from your analyses to the reporting stage thereby eliminating unseen copy/paste errors that inevitably occur when you consider the 1000 copy/paste actions that are likely to be performed every day of every week of every year.

This session will initially be spent examining the main elements of R Markdown for first time users. The second half will be a live (excruciatingly painful personal journey) build of an R Markdown report using the R-project from Session 1. Statistical outputs, tables and graphs will be automatically incorporated into the document, avoiding the possibility of errors that commonly occur when manually transferring information from one program to another. R Markdown documents can be (re-)produced in a wide variety of common formats including Word documents, PDF and HTML files.

The take home message from this session is: 

If I can build an R Markdown report in a room "full" of people watching me, then you can easily do it too in the privacy of your own home!!

## **Session 3:**
### *How to integrate Git with RStudio*

During the research life cycle the work undertaken changes and evolves. Sometimes we need to know what those changes were. Git is a version control system that enables you to track timestamped copies of your work. 

While before you might have had multiple copies of the same file on your system, with Git, you can navigate between older versions through a single master file, restore previous versions and much, much more. Downstream from this, GitHub is an online hosting service that allows you to publicly share your code or engage with collaborators remotely. The added advantage is that you will have both a local and online copy of your work.

## **Session 4:**
### *Open Science and reporducible research*

This session will be delivered to University College Cork postgraduate students on the need, benefits and paths towards reproducible research. It will start with some horror stories of high profile faults in the wider research arena. This will be followed with initiatives that are taking place now to address this. I'll finish with a predictable call to learn R as a means to achieve this!  

## **Session 5:**
### *Correctly reporting your clinical trial*
### *HRB TMRN workshop, 28th July 2019, Catherine McAuley Lecture Theatre, University College Dublin*

The workshop will be provided in three parts.
1. How to register and report your clinical trial in EuroCt and ClinicalTrails.gov - Sebastian Vencken
2. How to correctly report your clinical trial in scientific journals - Darren Dahly
3. Methods to further enhance transparency and reproducibility of your clinical trial - Brendan Palmer

The notes for part 3 are provided here.
