# lunchtime_sessions

Short 1 hour introductions to R-related topics such as creating R projects, using GitHub through RStudio and more 

## **Session 1:**
### *R-projects*

The foundation to reproducible research starts not with your PI, your lab colleagues or your collaborators. It starts with you! How do you organise your research projects? How do you keep track of the data as you collect it. How readily can you go back to a set of analyses you've performed in the past and re-run to include new variables you may have at your disposal or, perhaps more importantly, confirm that critical calculation your performed 6 months ago?

The answer to many, if not all of these questions, can be found through the use of R/Rstudio and implementation of a defined research project structure made possible with R-projects.
