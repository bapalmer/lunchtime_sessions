knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, 
                      fig.width  = 6, fig.height = 4)

# The clean data file is called within each of the plots and analysis scripts
# source("scripts/01_data_cleaning.R")

# To get the output to save in the docs folder use:
# rmarkdown::render('all_together.now', output_file = 'docs/example_project_report.docx') in the console
